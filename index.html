                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Kelsey and I'm an aspiring software engineer. I'm currently located in Atlanta and I graduated from Georgia State University. I enjoy collaborating with other team members to create and develop unique mobile applications as well as interactive web page designs. My journey as a software engineer is just getting started so feel free to visit my page again to see updated projects I create along the way!

                    Fun fact: I studied abroad in three different countries to learn the Spanish language. Â¡Pura Vida!
